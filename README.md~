# CourseSelection
Algorithm for choosing Princeton courses based on binary search

courses.db is the database file. It stores the coursedata table.

courses.json stores data about Spring '17 courses in JSON format

create.py drops the old coursedata table and creates a new one

write.py fills the coursedata table with data from courses.json

read.py implements our course selection algorithm



#

Usage:

$python create.py

$python write.py

$python read.py
